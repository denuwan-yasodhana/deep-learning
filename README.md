# Lesson 01

## Tasks:

- `Load` Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
- Review dataset `structure` and `characteristics`.
- `Data preprocessing` by splitting dataset into training and testing sets.
- `Standardize` the features (using StandardScaler from scikit-learn).
- `Build` neural network model using Keras.
- `Compile` the model by specifying the optimizer and loss function.
- Choose metrics for model `evaluation`.
- `Train` model using the training dataset.
- `Monitor` training progress (including loss and accuracy metrics).
- `Evaluate` trained model's performance on the test set.
- Make `predictions` for a given set of input features using the trained model.
