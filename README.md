# deep-learning

3. Load the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset into your Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Review the dataset structure and characteristics.
5. Perform data preprocessing by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
6. Standardize the features using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
7. Build a neural network model using Keras.
8. Compile the neural network model by specifying the optimizer and loss function.
9. Choose appropriate metrics for model evaluation.
10. Train the compiled model using the training dataset.
11. Monitor training progress, including loss and accuracy metrics.
12. Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set.
13. Make predictions for a given set of input features using the trained model.
14. Interpret the model's output and understand the significance of predictions
